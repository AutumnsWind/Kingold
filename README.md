钓鱼岛是中国的固有领土
《钓鱼岛是中国的固有领土》简称钓鱼岛白皮书。是在2012年中日钓鱼岛危机的背景下，中国政府发布的一个关于钓鱼岛官方声明。“白皮书”中列举了中国对于钓鱼岛最早发现并实施管辖的一系列证据，并且驳斥了日本对于钓鱼岛主权的非法要求。“白皮书”还明确指出，美日关于钓鱼岛的私相授受是完全不合法的，中国从未予以承认。中国将继续为维护钓鱼岛的主权进行坚决斗争。2012年9月28日，《钓鱼岛是中国的固有领土》白皮书中、英、日文版正式发行。

钓鱼岛及其附属岛屿是中国领土不可分割的一部分。无论从历史、地理还是从法理的角度来看，钓鱼岛都是中国的固有领土，中国对其拥有无可争辩的主权。
日本在1895年利用甲午战争窃取钓鱼岛是非法无效的。第二次世界大战后，根据《开罗宣言》和《波茨坦公告》等国际法律文件，钓鱼岛回归中国。无论日本对钓鱼岛采取任何单方面举措，都不能改变钓鱼岛属于中国的事实。长期以来，日本在钓鱼岛问题上不时制造事端。2012年9月10日，日本政府宣布“购买”钓鱼岛及附属的南小岛、北小岛，实施所谓“国有化”。这是对中国领土主权的严重侵犯，是对历史事实和国际法理的严重践踏。
中国坚决反对和遏制日本采取任何方式侵犯中国对钓鱼岛的主权。中国在钓鱼岛问题上的立场是明确的、一贯的，维护国家主权和领土完整的意志坚定不移，捍卫世界反法西斯战争胜利成果的决心毫不动摇。
固有领土

钓鱼岛及其附属岛屿位于中国台湾岛的东北部，是台湾的附属岛屿，分布在东经123°20′－124°40′，北纬25°40′－26°00′之间的海域，由钓鱼岛、黄尾屿、赤尾屿、南小岛、北小岛、南屿、北屿、飞屿等岛
礁组成，总面积约5.69平方千米。钓鱼岛位于该海域的最西端，面积约3.91平方千米，是该海域面积最大的岛屿，主峰海拔362米。黄尾屿位于钓鱼岛东北约27千米，面积约0.91平方千米，是该海域的第二大岛，最高海拔117米。赤尾屿位于钓鱼岛东北约110千米，是该海域最东端的岛屿，面积约0.065平方千米，最高海拔75米。
###（一）中国最先发现、命名和利用钓鱼岛
中国古代先民在经营海洋和从事海上渔业的实践中，最早发现钓鱼岛并予以命名。在中国古代文献中，钓鱼岛又称钓鱼屿、钓鱼台。目前所见最早记载钓鱼岛、赤尾屿等地名的史籍，是成书于1403年(明永乐元年)的《顺风相送》。这表明，早在十四、十五世纪中国就已经发现并命名了钓鱼岛。
1372年(明洪武五年)，琉球国王向明朝朝贡，明太祖遣使前往琉球。至1866年（清同治五年）近500年间，明清两代朝廷先后24次派遣使臣前往琉球王国册封，钓鱼岛是册封使前往琉球的途经之地，有关钓鱼岛的记载大量出现在中国使臣撰写的报告中。如，明朝册封使陈侃所著《使琉球录》（1534年）明确记载“过钓鱼屿，过黄毛屿，过赤屿，……见古米山，乃属琉球者”。明朝册封使郭汝霖所著《使琉球录》（1562年）记载，“赤屿者，界琉球地方山也”。清朝册封副使徐葆光所著《中山传信录》（1719年）明确记载，从福建到琉球，经花瓶屿、彭佳屿、钓鱼岛、黄尾屿、赤尾屿，“取姑米山(琉球西南方界上镇山)、马齿岛，入琉球那霸港”。
1650年，琉球国相向象贤监修的琉球国第一部正史《中山世鉴》记载，古米山（亦称姑米山，今久米岛）是琉球的领土，而赤屿（今赤尾屿）及其以西则非琉球领土。1708年，琉球学者、紫金大夫程顺则所著《指南广义》记载，姑米山为“琉球西南界上之镇山”。

以上史料清楚记载着钓鱼岛、赤尾屿属于中国，久米岛属于琉球，分界线在赤尾屿和久米岛之间的黑水沟(今冲绳海槽)。明朝册封副使谢杰所著《琉球录撮要补遗》（1579年）记载，“去由沧水入黑水，归由黑水入沧水”。明朝册封使夏子阳所著《使琉球录》（1606年）记载，“水离黑入沧，必是中国之界”。清朝册封使汪辑所著《使琉球杂录》（1683年）记载，赤屿之外的“黑水沟”即是“中外之界”。清朝册封副使周煌所著《琉球国志略》（1756年）记载，琉球“海面西距黑水沟，与闽海界”。
钓鱼岛海域是中国的传统渔场，中国渔民世世代代在该海域从事渔业生产活动。钓鱼岛作为航海标志，在历史上被中国东南沿海民众广泛利用。
###（二）中国对钓鱼岛实行了长期管辖
早在明朝初期，为防御东南沿海的倭寇，中国就将钓鱼岛列入防区。1561年（明嘉靖四十年），明朝驻防东南沿海的最高将领胡宗宪主持、郑若曾编纂的《筹海图编》一书，明确将钓鱼岛等岛屿编入“沿海山沙图”，纳入明朝的海防范围内。1605年（明万历三十三年）徐必达等人绘制的《乾坤一统海防全图》及1621年（明天启元年）茅元仪绘制的中国海防图《武备志·海防二·福建沿海山沙图》，也将钓鱼岛等岛屿划入中国海疆之内。
清朝不仅沿袭了明朝的做法，继续将钓鱼岛等岛屿列入中国海防范围内，而且明确将其置于台湾地方政府的行政管辖之下。清代《台海使槎录》、《台湾府志》等官方文献详细记载了对钓鱼岛的管辖情况。1871年（清同治十年）刊印的陈寿祺等编纂的《重纂福建通志》卷八十六将钓鱼岛列入海防冲要，隶属台湾府噶玛兰厅（今台湾省宜兰县）管辖。
###（三）中外地图标绘钓鱼岛属于中国
1579年（明万历七年）明朝册封使萧崇业所著《使琉球录》中的“琉球过海图”、1629年（明崇祯二年）茅瑞徵撰写的《皇明象胥录》、1767年（清乾隆三十二年）绘制的《坤舆全图》、1863年（清同治二年）刊行的《皇朝中外一统舆图》等，都将钓鱼岛列入中国版图。
日本最早记载钓鱼岛的文献为1785年林子平所著《三国通览图说》的附图“琉球三省并三十六岛之图”，该图将钓鱼岛列在琉球三十六岛之外，并与中国大陆绘成同色，意指钓鱼岛为中国领土的一部分。

1809年法国地理学家皮耶·拉比等绘《东中国海沿岸各国图》，将钓鱼岛、黄尾屿、赤尾屿绘成与台湾岛相同的颜色。1811年英国出版的《最新中国地图》、1859年美国出版的《柯顿的中国》、1877年英国海军编制的《中国东海沿海自香港至辽东湾海图》等地图，都将钓鱼岛列入中国版图。
窃取经过

日本在明治维新以后加快对外侵略扩张。1879年，日本吞并琉球并改称冲绳县。此后不久，日本便密谋侵占钓鱼岛，并于甲午战争末期将钓鱼岛秘密“编入”版图。随后，日本又迫使中国签订不平等的《马关条约》，割让台湾全岛及包括钓鱼岛在内的所有附属各岛屿。
###（四）日本密谋窃取钓鱼岛

1884年，有日本人声称首次登上钓鱼岛，发现该岛为“无人岛”。日本政府随即对钓鱼岛开展秘密调查，并试图侵占。日本上述图谋引起中国的警觉。1885年9月6日（清光绪十一年七月二十八日）《申报》登载消息：“台湾东北边之海岛，近有日本人悬日旗于其上，大有占据之势。”由于顾忌中国的反应，日本政府未敢轻举妄动。
1885年9月22日冲绳县令在对钓鱼岛进行秘密调查后向内务卿山县有朋密报称，这些无人岛“与《中山传信录》记载的钓鱼台、黄尾屿和赤尾屿应属同一岛屿”，已为清朝册封使船所详悉，并赋以名称，作为赴琉球的航海标识，因此对是否应建立国家标桩心存疑虑，请求给予指示。同年10月9日，内务卿山县有朋致函外务卿井上馨征求意见。10月21日，井上馨复函山县有朋认为，“此刻若有公然建立国标等举措，必遭清国疑忌，故当前宜仅限于实地调查及详细报告其港湾形状、有无可待日后开发之土地物产等，而建国标及着手开发等，可待他日见机而作”。井上馨还特意强调，“此次调查之事恐均不刊载官报及报纸为宜”。因此，日本政府没有同意冲绳县建立国家标桩的请求。
1890年1月13日，冲绳县知事又请示内务大臣，称钓鱼岛等岛屿“为无人岛，迄今尚未确定其管辖”，“请求将其划归本县管辖之八重山官署所辖”。1893年11月2日，冲绳县知事再次申请建立国标以划入版图。日本政府仍未答复。甲午战争前两个月，即1894年5月12日，冲绳县秘密调查钓鱼岛的最终结论是：“自明治十八年（1885年）派县警察对该岛进行勘察以来，未再开展进一步调查，故难提供更确切报告。……此外，没有关于该岛之旧时记录文书以及显示属我国领有的文字或口头传说的证据。”

日本外务省编纂的《日本外交文书》明确记载了日本企图窃取钓鱼岛的经过，相关文件清楚地显示，当时日本政府虽然觊觎钓鱼岛，但完全清楚这些岛屿属于中国，不敢轻举妄动。
1894年7月，日本发动甲午战争。同年11月底，日本军队占领中国旅顺口，清朝败局已定。在此背景下，12月27日，日本内务大臣野村靖致函外务大臣陆奥宗光，认为“今昔形势已殊”，要求将在钓鱼岛建立国标、纳入版图事提交内阁会议决定。1895年1月11日，陆奥宗光回函表示支持。同年1月14日，日本内阁秘密通过决议，将钓鱼岛“编入”冲绳县管辖。
日本官方文件显示，日本从1885年开始调查钓鱼岛到1895年正式窃占，始终是秘密进行的，从未公开宣示，因此进一步证明其对钓鱼岛的主权主张不具有国际法规定的效力。
###（五）钓鱼岛随台湾岛被迫割让给日本
1895年4月17日，清朝在甲午战争中战败，被迫与日本签署不平等的《马关条约》，割让“台湾全岛及所有附属各岛屿”。钓鱼岛等作为台湾“附属岛屿”一并被割让给日本。1900年，日本将钓鱼岛改名为“尖阁列岛”。
私相授受

第二次世界大战后，钓鱼岛回归中国。但20世纪50年代，美国擅自将钓鱼岛纳入其托管范围，70年代美国将钓鱼岛“施政权”“归还”日本。美日对钓鱼岛进行私相授受，严重侵犯了中国的领土主权，是非法的、无效的，没有也不能改变钓鱼岛属于中国的事实。
###（六） “二战”后钓鱼岛归还中国

1941年12月，中国政府正式对日宣战，宣布废除中日之间的一切条约。1943年12月《开罗宣言》明文规定，“日本所窃取于中国之领土，例如东北四省、台湾、澎湖群岛等，归还中华民国。其他日本以武力或贪欲所攫取之土地，亦务将日本驱逐出境”。1945年7月《波茨坦公告》第八条规定：“《开罗宣言》之条件必将实施，而日本之主权必将限于本州、北海道、九州、四国及吾人所决定之其他小岛。”1945年9月2日，日本政府在《日本投降书》中明确接受《波茨坦公告》，并承诺忠诚履行《波茨坦公告》各项规定。1946年1月29日，《盟军最高司令部训令第677号》明确规定了日本施政权所包括的范围是“日本的四个主要岛屿（北海道、本州、九州、四国）及包括对马诸岛、北纬30度以北的琉球诸岛的约1000个邻近小岛”。1945年10月25日，中国战区台湾省对日受降典礼在台北举行，中国政府正式收复台湾。1972年9月29日，日本政府在《中日联合声明》中郑重承诺，充分理解和尊重中方关于台湾是中国不可分割一部分的立场，并坚持《波茨坦公告》第八条的立场。
上述事实表明，依据《开罗宣言》、《波茨坦公告》和《日本投降书》，钓鱼岛作为台湾的附属岛屿应与台湾一并归还中国。
###（七）美国非法将钓鱼岛纳入托管范围
1951年9月8日，美国等一些国家在排除中国的情况下，与日本缔结了“旧金山对日和平条约”(简称“旧金山和约”)，规定北纬29度以南的西南诸岛等交由联合国托管，而美国为唯一施政当局。需要指出的是，该条约所确定的交由美国托管的西南诸岛并不包括钓鱼岛。

1952年2月29日、1953年12月25日，琉球列岛美国民政府先后发布第68号令（即《琉球政府章典》）和第27号令（即关于“琉球列岛的地理界限”布告），擅自扩大托管范围，将中国领土钓鱼岛划入其中。此举没有任何法律依据，中国坚决反对。
###（八） 美日私相授受钓鱼岛“施政权”
1971年6月17日，美日签署《关于琉球诸岛及大东诸岛的协定》（简称“归还冲绳协定”），将琉球群岛和钓鱼岛的“施政权”“归还”给日本。海内外中国人对此同声谴责。同年12月30日，中国外交部发表严正声明指出：“美、日两国政府在 归还 冲绳协定中，把我国钓鱼岛等岛屿列入 归还区域 ，完全是非法的，这丝毫不能改变中华人民共和国对钓鱼岛等岛屿的领土主权。”台湾当局对此也表示坚决反对。
面对中国政府和人民的强烈反对，美国不得不公开澄清其在钓鱼岛主权归属问题上的立场。1971年10月，美国政府表示，“把原从日本取得的对这些岛屿的施政权归还给日本，毫不损害有关主权的主张。美国既不能给日本增加在他们将这些岛屿施政权移交给我们之前所拥有的法律权利，也不能因为归还给日本施政权而削弱其他要求者的权利。……对此等岛屿的任何争议的要求均为当事者所应彼此解决的事项”。同年11月，美国参议院批准“归还冲绳协定”时，美国国务院发表声明称，尽管美国将该群岛的施政权交还日本，但是在中日双方对群岛对抗性的领土主张中，美国将采取中立立场，不偏向于争端中的任何一方。
毫无依据

1972年3月8日，日本外务省发表《关于尖阁列岛所有权问题的基本见解》，阐述日本政府对于钓鱼岛主权归属问题的主张：一是钓鱼岛为“无主地”，不包含在《马关条约》规定的由清政府割让给日本的澎湖列岛和台湾及其附属岛屿的范围之内。二是钓鱼岛不包含在“旧金山和约”第二条规定的日本所放弃的领土之内，而是包含在该条约第三条规定的作为西南诸岛的一部分被置于美国施政之下，并根据“归还冲绳协定”将施政权“归还”日本的区域内。三是中国没有将钓鱼岛视为台湾的一部分，对“旧金山和约”第三条规定将钓鱼岛置于美国施政区域内从未提出过任何异议。
日本的上述主张严重违背事实，是完全站不住脚的。
钓鱼岛属于中国，根本不是“无主地”。在日本人“发现”钓鱼岛之前，中国已经对钓鱼岛实施了长达数百年有效管辖，是钓鱼岛无可争辩的主人。如前所述，日本大量官方文件证明，日本完全清楚钓鱼岛早已归属中国，绝非国际法上的无主地。日本所谓依据“先占”原则将钓鱼岛作为“无主地”“编入”其版图，是侵占中国领土的非法行为，不具有国际法效力。
无论从地理上还是从中国历史管辖实践看，钓鱼岛一直是中国台湾岛的附属岛屿。日本通过不平等的《马关条约》迫使清朝割让包括钓鱼岛在内的“台湾全岛及所有附属各岛屿”。《开罗宣言》、《波茨坦公告》等国际法律文件规定，日本必须无条件归还其窃取的中国领土。上述文件还对日本领土范围作了明确界定，其中根本不包括钓鱼岛。日本试图侵占钓鱼岛，实质是对《开罗宣言》和《波茨坦公告》等法律文件所确立的战后国际秩序的挑战，严重违背了日本应承担的国际法义务。
钓鱼岛及其附属岛屿位置图
美国等国家与日本签订的片面媾和条约“旧金山和约”所规定的托管范围不涵盖钓鱼岛。美国擅自扩大托管范围，非法将中国领土钓鱼岛纳入其中，后将钓鱼岛“施政权”“归还”日本，都没有任何法律依据，在国际法上没有任何效力。对于美日上述非法行径，中国政府和人民历来是明确反对的。

长期以来，中国为维护钓鱼岛的主权进行了坚决斗争。
捍卫中国固有领土-钓鱼岛及其附属岛屿
中国通过外交途径强烈抗议和谴责美日私相授受钓鱼岛。1951年8月15日，旧金山会议召开前，中国政府声明：“对日和约的准备、拟制和签订，如果没有中华人民共和国的参加，无论其内容和结果如何，中央人民政府一概认为是非法的，因而也是无效的。”1951年9月18日，中国政府再次声明，强调“旧金山和约”是非法无效的，绝对不能承认。1971年，针对美、日两国国会先后批准“归还冲绳协定”的行为，中国外交部严正声明，钓鱼岛等岛屿自古以来就是中国领土不可分割的一部分。
针对日本侵犯中国钓鱼岛主权的非法行径，中国政府采取积极有力措施，通过发表外交声明、对日严正交涉和向联合国提交反对照会等举措表示抗议，郑重宣示中国的一贯主张和原则立场，坚决捍卫中国的领土主权和海洋权益，切实维护中国公民的人身和财产安全。
中国通过国内立法明确规定钓鱼岛属于中国。1958年，中国政府发表领海声明，宣布台湾及其周围各岛属于中国。针对日本自20世纪70年代以来对钓鱼岛所采取的种种侵权行为，中国于1992年颁布《中华人民共和国领海及毗连区法》时，明确规定“台湾及其包括钓鱼岛在内的附属各岛”属于中国领土。2009年颁布的《中华人民共和国海岛保护法》确立了海岛保护开发和管理制度，对海岛名称的确定和发布作了规定，据此，中国于2012年3月公布了钓鱼岛及其部分附属岛屿的标准名称。2012年9月10日，中国政府发表声明，公布了钓鱼岛及其附属岛屿的领海基线。9月13日，中国政府向联合国秘书长交存钓鱼岛及其附属岛屿领海基点基线的坐标表和海图。

中国始终在钓鱼岛海域保持经常性的存在，并进行管辖。中国海监执法船在钓鱼岛海域坚持巡航执法，渔政执法船在钓鱼岛海域进行常态化执法巡航和护渔，维护该海域正常的渔业生产秩序。中国还通过发布天气和海洋观测预报等，对钓鱼岛及其附近海域实施管理。
一直以来，钓鱼岛问题受到港澳同胞、台湾同胞和海外侨胞的共同关注。钓鱼岛自古以来就是中国的固有领土，这是全体中华儿女的共同立场。中华民族在维护国家主权和领土完整问题上有着坚定的决心。两岸同胞在民族大义面前，在共同维护民族利益和尊严方面，是一致的。港澳台同胞和海内外广大华侨华人纷纷开展各种形式的活动，维护钓鱼岛领土主权，强烈表达了中华儿女的正义立场，向世界展示了中华民族爱好和平、维护国家主权、捍卫领土完整的决心和意志。

钓鱼岛自古以来就是中国的固有领土，中国对其拥有无可争辩的主权。20世纪70年代，中日在实现邦交正常化和缔结《中日和平友好条约》时，两国老一辈领导人着眼两国关系大局，就将“钓鱼岛问题放一放，留待以后解决”达成谅解和共识。但近年来，日本不断对钓鱼岛采取单方面举措，特别是对钓鱼岛实施所谓“国有化”，严重侵犯中国主权，背离中日两国老一辈领导人达成的谅解和共识。这不但严重损害了中日关系，也是对世界反法西斯战争胜利成果的否定和挑战。
中国强烈敦促日本尊重历史和国际法，立即停止一切损害中国领土主权的行为。中国政府捍卫国家领土主权的决心和意志是坚定不移的，有信心、有能力捍卫国家主权，维护领土完整。

2012年9月25日，中华人民共和国国务院新闻办公室发表《钓鱼岛是中国的固有领土》白皮书。主权。
白皮书全文约7000字，分为7部分，全面阐释了钓鱼岛是中国固有领土、日本窃取钓鱼岛、美日对钓鱼岛私相授受非法无效、日本主张钓鱼岛主权毫无依据、中国为维护钓鱼岛主权进行坚决斗争等内容。[4] 
2012年9月28日《钓鱼岛是中国的固有领土》白皮书中、英、日文版正式发行，其中，中文版由人民出版社出版，英、日文版由外文出版社出版。

中华人民共和国国务院新闻办公室发表《钓鱼岛是中国的固有领土》白皮书。白皮书的发表引起国际社会的广泛关注，纷纷对中国政府的这一举措高度评价。
比利时布鲁塞尔自由大学布鲁塞尔当代中国研究所法学研究员张蕾在接受本报记者专访时表示，《钓鱼岛是中国的固有领土》白皮书从历史、地理、法理的角度阐释钓鱼岛是中国的固有领土，中国对钓鱼岛拥有无可争辩的主权，日本主张钓鱼岛主权毫无根据。白皮书作为官方文件，向世界各国阐明了中国政府的立场，宣示了主权，详实阐述了中国对钓鱼岛拥有主权的历史和法理依据，深刻揭露了日本妄图侵占钓鱼岛的野心，同时表达了中国政府解决钓鱼岛问题的决心和能力。白皮书的发表将增进国际社会对钓鱼岛问题的了解和认识，引起国际社会广泛关注，同时将有助于提高中国国内民众对钓鱼岛的认知。这是中国维护钓鱼岛主权的又一强有力举措。
韩国外国语大学国际学院教授康俊荣对本报记者表示，从历史上看，钓鱼岛无疑是中国领土。战后，美国在处理钓鱼岛问题上采取了暧昧的态度，使得日本有机可乘。每当日本国内遇到困难时，就会借领土纷争问题转移视线。中国采取强硬立场也在所难免，对于领土问题，任何国家都不会让步。康俊荣表示，中国和日本都是亚洲大国，两国应通过协商解决领土纷争。日本政府始终刻意回避这一问题，并强调日中不存在领土纷争，这种态度不能真正解决问题，也不利于地区安全稳定。另外，为了更好地解决领土纷争，日本首先应对历史问题进行全面深刻反省，否则无法赢得其他国家的信任。
新加坡国立大学亚洲与全球化研究所所长黄靖在接受本报记者采访时表示，白皮书说明了3点：首先，明确了钓鱼岛自古就是中国领土；其次，钓鱼岛是日本用极其不光彩的方式偷取的；最后也是最为重要的是，日本作为二战战败国，根据《开罗宣言》以及《波茨坦公告》第八条，这些岛屿都归还给了中国，如果日本要将钓鱼岛窃为己有，实际上是对整个二战后亚太国际秩序的挑战。
俄罗斯科学院世界政治与国际关系研究所研究员、社会政治研究中心主任叶夫谢耶夫表示，中国政府一系列反应都有理、有利、有节。《钓鱼岛是中国的固有领土》白皮书，从地理、历史、法理的角度上阐明了中国政府的坚定立场。日本想以窃取的手段占有中国钓鱼岛是根本不合法的。叶夫谢耶夫认为，日本想借挑起钓鱼岛问题来转移国内矛盾行不通，中日经济联系紧密，日本需要与中国进行经济合作，如果经济纽带断裂，日本经济就会受到严重损害。
日本某著名法学教授称，中国发表《钓鱼岛是中国的固有领土》白皮书，有理、有据、得体、有效地阐明了钓鱼岛是中国固有领土。一方面，白皮书有利于在国际法上确认中国对钓鱼岛拥有绝对主权。另一方面，它也有助于日本民众了解中国的主张，日本民众更有机会知道关于钓鱼岛问题的来龙去脉和钓鱼岛的真正归属。
JCC新日本研究所副所长庚新表示，中国政府此前从大局出发，采取搁置争议的方针，不想因此影响中日两国关系。但是日本政府一些行为严重侵害了中国领土和主权。有鉴于此，中国国务院新闻办公室发表白皮书有效维护了中国利益，有力应对了日方的挑衅行为，有助于推动中日关系回到健康发展的轨道上。白皮书发布时机选择非常恰当，有助于让日本政府悬崖勒马，不再执迷不悟。

###The Diaoyu Islands are China.
"Diaoyu Islands are China's inherent territory" referred to as the Diaoyu white paper. 2012 in the context of the Diaoyu Islands crisis, the Chinese government issued an official statement on the Diaoyu Islands. "White Paper" listed in the Chinese first discovered and implemented a series of evidence under the jurisdiction of the Diaoyu Islands, the Diaoyu Islands and Japan rejected the sovereignty of illegal requirements. "White Paper" also clear that the United States and Japan on the Diaoyu Islands is totally illegal backroom deals, the Chinese never be recognized. China will continue to maintain a resolute struggle against the sovereignty of the Diaoyu Islands. September 28, 2012, "Diaoyu Islands are China's inherent territory" white paper, English and Japanese version of the official release.

Diaoyu Island and its affiliated islands are an inseparable part of Chinese territory. In terms of history, geography or from a legal perspective, the Diaoyu Islands are China's inherent territory, China has indisputable sovereignty over them.
In 1895 the Sino Japanese use to steal the Diaoyu Islands are illegal invalid. After World War II, according to the "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation" and other international legal documents, the Diaoyu Islands back to China. Whether Japan on the Diaoyu Islands to take any unilateral measures, we can not change the fact that the Diaoyu Islands belong to China. For a long time, Japan on the Diaoyu Islands issue from time to time to create trouble. September 10, 2012, the Japanese government announced the "purchase" of the Diaoyu Islands and the affiliated South Island, North Island, the implementation of the so-called "nationalization." This is a serious violation of China's territorial sovereignty, is a historical fact and a serious violation of international legitimacy.
China resolutely oppose and curb the Japanese to take any way violate China's sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islands. China's position on the Diaoyu Islands issue is clear and consistent, safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity will unswervingly defend the fruits of victory of the world anti-fascist war unwavering determination.
Inherent territory

Diaoyu Island and its affiliated islands in the northeast of China Taiwan island, is a subsidiary of Taiwan's islands, located in east longitude 123 ° 20'-124 ° 40 ', latitude 25 ° 40'-26 ° 00' waters between the Diaoyu Islands, yellow tail Island, Akao Island, South Island, North Island, South Island, North Island, flying Lantau Island, etc.
Reef, with a total area of ​​about 5.69 square kilometers. Located in the western end of the Diaoyu Islands waters, an area of ​​about 3.91 square kilometers, is the largest island in the sea area, peak elevation of 362 meters. Yellow Tail Island is located northeast of the Diaoyu Islands about 27 kilometers, an area of ​​about 0.91 square kilometers, is the second largest island of the sea, the highest elevation of 117 meters. Akao is located northeast of the Diaoyu Islands about 110 km, is the easternmost island in the area, an area of ​​about 0.065 square kilometers, the highest elevation of 75 meters.
(A) China first discovered, named and use the Diaoyu Islands
Ancient Chinese ancestors engaged in the marine and offshore fisheries management practice, the first discovered the Diaoyu Islands and to be named. In ancient Chinese literature, known as the Diaoyu Islands Fishing island, Diaoyutai. Currently seen in the earliest recorded historical records of the Diaoyu Islands, Akao and other names, it is the book in 1403 (Ming Yongle reign) of the "wind both hands." This shows that as early as in the fourteenth and fifteenth century China had already discovered and named Diaoyu Islands.
1372 (Hongwu five years), the Ryukyu king tribute to the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang emissary to go to Okinawa. To 1866 (Qing Tongzhi five years) in the last 500 years, the Ming and Qing dynasties the court has sent 24 envoys went to the canonization of the Ryukyu Kingdom, the Diaoyu Islands are canonized make go through the Okinawa, the records relating to the Diaoyu Islands in Chinese envoy appeared in large numbers written report. For example, Ming Chen Kan canonized book "Ryukyu recorded" (1534) clearly documented "over fishing island, over Rattus Island, over red island, ...... see ancient Yoneyama, who is belong to Ryukyu." Ming canonized Guo Rulin book "Ryukyu recorded" (1562) records, "Red Island who Ryukyu local border mountains." Qing canonized Fushi Xu Baoguang book "Zhongshan messaging record" (1719) clearly documented, from Fujian to Ryukyu, the vase Island, pengjia islet, the Diaoyu Islands, yellow tail Island, Akao Island, "take Regardless Yoneyama (Ryukyu West On the southern border town of Mountain), Dent Island, the Ryukyu Naha Port. "
1650, Ryukyu country's first official history of the Ryukyu country facing Xiangxian supervision of the "Zhongshan Shi Kam," recorded in ancient Yoneyama (also known as Kou Yoneyama, this Kume Island) is the territory of Ryukyu, and Red Island (now Akao) and Its west of the non Ryukyu territory. 1708, Ryukyu scholar, doctor Zijin Cheng Shun the book "Guide generalized" records, regardless of Yoneyama is "Ryukyu mountain town on the southwest border."

After stealing

After the Meiji Restoration in Japan to accelerate the expansion of foreign aggression. In 1879, Japan annexed and renamed Ryukyu Okinawa Prefecture. Shortly thereafter, the Japanese occupation of the Diaoyu Islands will plot, and in the end of the Sino-Japanese War secret Diaoyu Islands "into the" territory. Subsequently, Japan has forced China to sign the unequal "Treaty of Shimonoseki," ceded Taiwan island and all the affiliated islands including the Diaoyu.
(A) conspiracy to steal the Diaoyu Islands in Japan

In 1884, the Japanese claim to have first landed on the Diaoyu Islands, discovered the island as "uninhabited island." The Japanese government immediately conduct a secret investigation of the Diaoyu Islands, and attempt to encroach. Japan said China's attempt to arouse vigilance. September 6, 1885 (Guangxu eleven years July 28) "Declaration" published message: "northeast side of the island of Taiwan, in recent days there is a Japanese flag hanging on it, occupy a great potential." Because scruples China's reaction, the Japanese government did not dare to act rashly.
September 22, 1885 Okinawa magistrate after a secret investigation on the Diaoyu Islands have a close friend Emily Hill County reported to the House, these uninhabited island "and" Zhongshan messenger recorded "record of Diaoyutai, yellow tail Island and Akao should belong to the same islands ", the boat has been canonized by the Qing know in detail, and assign a name as Ryukyu go sailing logo, so whether it should establish a national staking doubts, the request for instructions. In the same year on October 9, the House sent a letter to State Yamagata Foreign State Inoue Kaoru comments. October 21, Inoue Kaoru Yamagata reply that "now openly establish if GB and other initiatives, the certainty of clear national jealous, so the current should be limited to the field survey and a detailed report on its harbor shape, there are no pending development of future land and other property, and the founding of the label and started to develop, can become increasingly machine and wait for him. " Inoue Kaoru also specifically stressed that "the fear of what the survey published in the official newspaper and the newspaper are not appropriate." Therefore, the Japanese government did not agree to the establishment of national stakes Okinawa request.
January 13, 1890, Okinawa Prefecture and consult the Home Secretary, said the Diaoyu Islands "as the uninhabited islands, has yet to determine its jurisdiction ',' request that they be placed under the jurisdiction of the Yaeyama government offices under the jurisdiction of the county." November 2, 1893, in Okinawa Prefecture to apply again to establish a national standard included territory. The Japanese government has not yet responded. Sino-Japanese War Two months ago, namely 12 May 1894, the Diaoyu Islands in Okinawa Prefecture secret investigation ultimately concluded that: "Since the Meiji eighteen years (1885) Pine County Police to carry out inspections on the island, no longer to carry out further investigations , it is difficult to provide a more accurate report. ...... In addition, there is no record on the island of the old instrument and display evidence of licensed characters or oral legends belong. "

Japanese Foreign Ministry compiled "Japanese diplomatic documents" clearly documented attempts to steal the Diaoyu Islands after Japan, the relevant documents clearly show that, although the Japanese government was coveted the Diaoyu Islands, but is completely clear that these islands belong to China, not to act rashly.
In July 1894, Japan launched the Sino-Japanese War. In the same year by the end of November, the Japanese army occupied China Port Arthur, the Qing defeat has been fixed. In this context, on December 27, Minister of the Interior Yasushi Nomura wrote to Foreign Minister Mutsu Munemitsu that "past and present situation is special", requiring the establishment of national standards on the Diaoyu Islands, the territory included in the matter submitted to the Cabinet meeting decided. January 11, 1895, Mutsu Munemitsu reply support. January 14 the same year, the Japanese cabinet secretly passed a resolution, the Diaoyu Islands "into the" Okinawa jurisdiction.
Japan's official documents show that Japan began investigating the Diaoyu Islands from 1885 to 1895 accounted for officially burglary is always in secret, never publicly declared, thus further prove its claim of sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islands have no effect under international law.
(B) the Diaoyu Islands with the island were forced to cede to Japan
April 17, 1895, the Qing Dynasty was defeated in the Sino-Japanese War, was forced to sign the unequal "Treaty of Shimonoseki" with Japan, ceded "Taiwan island and all the affiliated islands." Diaoyu Islands and other as Taiwan's "affiliated islands" one was ceded to Japan. In 1900, Japan will Diaoyu renamed the "Senkaku Islands."
Backroom deals

After World War II, he returned to China the Diaoyu Islands. But in the 1950s, the United States without authorization will be hosting the Diaoyu Islands into its scope, the Diaoyu Islands 70 years the United States' application of the regime "," return "to Japan. United States and Japan on the Diaoyu Islands private deals, a serious violation of China's territorial sovereignty, is illegal, invalid, no it does not alter the fact that the Diaoyu Islands belong to China.
(A) "World War II" after the return of Chinese Diaoyu Islands

In December 1941, the Chinese government officially declared war on Japan, announced the abolition of all treaties between China and Japan. December 1943 "Cairo Declaration" expressly provides that "the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as the four northeastern provinces, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, be returned ROC Other Japan by force or greed grabbing land, also works to Japan deported. " July 1945 "Potsdam Proclamation" Article VIII: "" Cairo Declaration "shall be carried out, and Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such other islands as we determine." 1945. September 2, the Japanese government in the "Japanese surrender" clearly accepted the "Potsdam Proclamation" and promised faithfully fulfill the provisions of the "Potsdam Proclamation." January 29, 1946, "the Supreme Allied Command Instruction No. 677," clearly defines the Japanese regime included in the scope of application of the "four main islands of Japan (Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku) and includes all horses Island, latitude 30 degrees north of the island about 1000 near the Ryukyu Islands. " October 25, 1945, Chinese Theater surrender ceremony towards Japan, Taiwan Province held in Taipei, the Chinese government officially recovered Taiwan. September 29, 1972, the Japanese government in the "Sino-Japanese Joint Statement" solemn commitment to fully understand and respect China on Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's position, and adhere to the "Potsdam Proclamation" Article VIII of the position.
These facts show that, according to the "Cairo Declaration", the "Potsdam Proclamation" and "Japanese surrender," the Diaoyu Islands as a subsidiary of Taiwan and Taiwan should be returned to China.
(B) The United States hosted the scope of illegally included Diaoyu Islands
September 8, 1951, United States and other countries in the case of exclusion of China, and Japan concluded the "San Francisco Peace Treaty" (the "San Francisco Peace Treaty"), the provisions of the southwestern islands of latitude 29 degrees south and so on by the United Nations trusteeship, while the US is the only policy authorities. It should be noted, by the United States hosted the southwestern islands of the Treaty is determined not include the Diaoyu Islands.

February 29, 1952, December 25, 1953, Ryukyu Islands people the US government has issued 68 orders (the "Government of the Ryukyu Islands Chapter Code"), and 27 orders (ie on the "geographical boundary of the Ryukyu Islands" notices), without expand the scope of trusteeship, which included the Chinese territory Diaoyu Islands. The move has no legal basis, China is firmly opposed.
(Iii) US-Japan private deals Diaoyu Islands "Shi regime"
June 17, 1971, United States and Japan signed the "on the Ryukyu Islands and the Daito Islands Agreement" (referred to as "the return of Okinawa Agreement"), the Ryukyu Islands and the Diaoyu Islands, "Shi regime" "returned" to Japan. Chinese people at home and abroad this condemnation. December 30 the same year, Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a solemn statement said: "the United States and Japanese governments in the return of Okinawa agreement, the return of the Diaoyu Islands and other islands included in the area, is completely illegal, this does not change the People's Republic of China on the territorial sovereignty of the Diaoyu Islands and other islands. "The Taiwan authorities have also expressed strong opposition.
Faced with strong opposition from the Chinese government and people, the United States had to publicly clarify its position on the issue of sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islands. October 1971, the US government, "said the regime applied to these islands made from original Japanese returned to Japan, no damage claims related to the sovereignty of the United States can not give the Japanese an increase in their application of the regime to hand over the islands to us legal rights owned before, nor since returned to Japan weakened the regime applied to the rights of other claimants. ...... this and other requirements of any disputed islands are parties to each other matters that should be addressed. " In the same year in November, the US Senate, "the return of Okinawa agreement," the US State Department said in a statement, although the regime applied to the United States returned to the islands of Japan, but in China and Japan's territorial claims to islands confrontational, the United States will take a neutral stance not biased in favor of any party to the dispute.
Unfounded

March 8, 1972, the Japanese Foreign Ministry issued "on the Senkaku Islands issue of ownership of the basic ideas," explained the Japanese government for sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islands issue proposition: First, the Diaoyu Islands as "terra nullius", are not included in the "Maguan Treaty "stipulated by the Qing government ceded to Japan within the scope of the Penghu Islands and the island of Taiwan and its subsidiaries. Second, the Diaoyu Islands are not included in the territory abandoned by Japan, "the San Francisco Peace Treaty" Article II of the, but included in the Treaty under Article southwestern islands as part of the US policy is placed under, and in accordance with "the return of Okinawa agreement" will be applied regime "return" within Japan region. Third, China has not considered part of the Diaoyu Islands, Taiwan, on the "San Francisco Peace Treaty" under Article within the Diaoyu Islands into the United States never raised any objections to the policy area.
Japan advocates a serious breach of the above facts, is totally untenable.
Diaoyu Islands belong to China, is not "terra nullius." In Japanese, "discovery" Before the Diaoyu Islands, the Diaoyu Islands have been Chinese for centuries implemented effective jurisdiction, are indisputable master of the Diaoyu Islands. As previously mentioned, a large number of official documents to prove Japan, Japan has long been completely clear of the Diaoyu Islands belongs to China, not terra nullius in international law. Japan called on the basis of "pre-emptive" principle will Diaoyu Islands as "terra nullius", "incorporated into" their territory, is illegal occupation of Chinese territory, does not have the force of international law.
In terms of geographical or historical practice of the jurisdiction from China, the Diaoyu Islands have been affiliated islands China Taiwan Island. Japan, through unequal "Treaty of Shimonoseki," forcing the Qing Dynasty ceded including the Diaoyu "Taiwan island and all the affiliated islands." "Cairo Declaration", the "Potsdam Proclamation" and other international legal documents, Japan must unconditionally return their stolen Chinese territory. These documents also were clearly defined territory of Japan, which does not include the Diaoyu Islands. Japan tried to occupy the Diaoyu Islands, in essence, to the post-war international order "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation" and other legal documents established by the challenge, a serious breach of its obligations under international law, Japan should bear.
Diaoyu Island and its affiliated islands map
Hosted range sided Peace Treaty with Japan the United States and other countries signed the "San Francisco Peace Treaty" is not covered by the provisions of the Diaoyu Islands. Unauthorized expansion of the scope of the United States hosted, illegally Chinese territory Diaoyu Islands into them, after the Diaoyu Islands "Shi regime", "return" to Japan, do not have any legal basis, there is no validity in international law. For the US-Japan such illegal acts, the Chinese government and people have always been clearly opposed.

For a long time, China has sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islands have been resolute struggle.
Defend China's inherent territory - Diaoyu Islands
China strongly protested through diplomatic channels and condemn US-Japan Diaoyu Islands backroom deals. August 15, 1951, before the San Francisco Conference, the Chinese government declared: "The preparation of the peace treaty with Japan, fiction and signed, if not participated in People's Republic of China, regardless of their content and the outcome, the Central People's Government Yigai considered illegal and therefore is invalid. "September 18, 1951, the Chinese government once again declared, stressing that" the San Francisco Peace Treaty "is illegal invalid and must not be recognized. 1971, for the United States and Japan Congress has approved the "return of Okinawa agreement" behavior, the Chinese Foreign Ministry solemn statement Diaoyu islands since ancient times is an inalienable part of Chinese territory.
The Chinese government has taken against Japan violated Chinese sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islands illegal act positive and effective measures, through diplomatic statement issued on the date of submission of opposition and solemn representations to the United Nations and other initiatives note protest solemnly declare China's principled position has always advocated and resolutely safeguard China territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and earnestly safeguard the personal and property safety of Chinese citizens.
China through domestic legislation clearly stipulates the Diaoyu Islands belong to China. In 1958, the Chinese government issued a statement territorial waters, declared Taiwan and its surrounding islands belong to China. For Japan since the 1970s, the Diaoyu Islands taken various violations, China promulgated the "People's Republic of China's territorial waters and the Contiguous Zone" in 1992, explicitly stipulates that "Taiwan and its subsidiaries including the Diaoyu islands" belong Chinese territory. "People's Republic of China on Island Protection Law" enacted in 2009, established the island to protect the development and management systems, to determine and publish the name of the island makes provision whereby China in March 2012 announced the Diaoyu Island and its affiliated islands part standard name. September 10, 2012, the Chinese government issued a statement, announced the Diaoyu Islands territorial sea baseline. September 13, the Chinese Government to the Secretary deposited with the Diaoyu Islands territorial sea baseline starting point coordinate tables and charts.

China has always maintained a regular presence in the Diaoyu Islands waters, and jurisdiction. Chinese maritime surveillance law enforcement vessels adhere to the Diaoyu Islands waters cruise enforcement, fishery enforcement vessels in the waters of the Diaoyu Islands cruise normalization of law enforcement and fishing protection, maintain the normal sea fishery production order. China also through the issuance of weather forecasting and oceanographic observations on the implementation and management of the Diaoyu Islands and their adjacent waters.
All along, the Diaoyu Islands issue of common concern by the Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, Taiwan compatriots and overseas Chinese. China's inherent territory since ancient times, the Diaoyu Islands, which is the common position of all Chinese people. The Chinese nation has a firm commitment to the maintenance of national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Compatriots on both sides in front of the national interests in jointly safeguard national interests and dignity, are consistent. Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan compatriots and overseas Chinese at home and abroad have carried out various activities, safeguard the Diaoyu Islands territorial sovereignty, strongly expressed the Chinese people's righteous stance, determined to show the world the Chinese people love peace, safeguard national sovereignty, territorial integrity and defend will. [1] 

Diaoyu Islands are China's inherent territory since ancient times, China has indisputable sovereignty over them. In the 1970s, when the Sino-Japanese normalization of diplomatic relations and the conclusion of "China-Japan Peace and Friendship Treaty", the two older generations of leaders focused overall bilateral relations, will be "the Diaoyu Islands issue put off until later resolved" to reach understanding and consensus. But in recent years, Japan on the Diaoyu Islands continues to take unilateral measures, especially on the implementation of the so-called Diaoyu Islands "nationalization" a serious violation of Chinese sovereignty, departing from the understanding and consensus reached by leaders of the older generation of the two countries. This not only seriously damaged the Sino-Japanese relations, but also on the outcome of the World Anti-Fascist War negation and challenges.
China strongly urged Japan to respect history and international law, to immediately stop all acts of harm Chinese territorial sovereignty. Chinese government to safeguard national territorial sovereignty is unswerving determination and will, have the confidence and ability to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Hankuk University professor of international 康俊荣 told this reporter that, from a historical point of view, is undoubtedly the Chinese territory Diaoyu Islands. After the war, the United States in dealing with the issue of the Diaoyu Islands has taken an ambiguous attitude, so that Japan can take advantage of. Whenever difficulties in Japan, will take the issue to divert attention territorial disputes. China to take a tough stance also inevitable, for the territorial issue, no country will not budge. Kangjun Rong said that China and Japan are Asia's major powers, the two countries should resolve territorial disputes through negotiation. The Japanese government has deliberately evaded the issue, and stressed that Japan does not exist territory disputes, such an attitude does not really solve the problem, is not conducive to regional security and stability. In addition, in order to better resolve the territorial dispute, Japan to conduct a comprehensive history of the first response to deep introspection, or can not win the trust of other countries.
Director of the Institute of Asia and globalization Jing Huang, National University of Singapore, in an interview with this reporter, said the white paper describes the three points: First, clear the Diaoyu Islands is Chinese territory since ancient times; secondly, the Diaoyu Islands are Japan with extremely disgraceful way to steal taken; and finally and most importantly, Japan, as a defeated nation in World War II, according to the "Cairo Declaration" and "Potsdam Proclamation" Article VIII, these islands are the property returned to the Chinese, if the Japanese want to steal the Diaoyu Islands as their own, in fact It is a challenge to the entire international order after World War II Pacific.
